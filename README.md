#### Overview

Amazon's affiliate program is a great way to support services, artists, and individuals who you value. These groups can generate links to interesting products and if you make a purchase, they get a small bit of that sale. What happens if you view that product and then browse to another option on Amazon, though? Or what if you loved the product, but didn't buy it until later. Amazon's affiliate links don't persist as you browse or when you return later. This plugin fixes that.

#### How to Use

Once you have installed the plugin, simply click the icon to open the options panel. Enter in an affiliate code from one of your favorite people or places and click "Save". Now every page you visit on Amazon will be an affiliate link!
